    "description": "Gets what device tokens are now invalid. Apple informs us when a push notification is sent to a device that can’t receive it because the application has been uninstalled. We mark the device token as inactive and immediately stop sending notifications to that device. Once a day is a good interval for querying the feedback service, but you can do it more often to save on bandwidth from unnecessary notifications. In the response, what does marked_inactive_on mean? Apple sends a timestamp for each device token returned via the feedback service. Since a device can be off the network for a while, this can be a point in the recent past. In order to make this API work smoothly for you, we record the timestamp we marked as inactive. This means you only need to query for data since the last time you queried. Once a day is a good timeframe, or once a week for very small or infrequently used applications. A few times a day is good for applications with heavy use.",
